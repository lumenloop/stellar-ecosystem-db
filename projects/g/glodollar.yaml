description: "Glo can be used like any other stablecoin, but it also enables a
  new crypto use case: donationless philanthropy. Like other stables, Glo Dollar
  makes money from the interest on the fiat reserves. The difference: the Glo
  Foundation does not make profits. Instead, they donate 100% of the interest
  received to GiveDirectly, the worldâ€™s fastest-growing charity. They provide
  basic incomes for people living in extreme poverty, in countries such as
  Kenya."
